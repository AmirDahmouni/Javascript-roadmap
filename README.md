## ðŸ“¦ Object Type

The **object** type refers to a compound value where you can set properties. Each property can hold its own value of any type.

```javascript
var obj = {
  a: "hello world",
  b: 42,
  c: true
};
```

JavaScript provides a **typeof** operator that can examine a value and tell you what type it is:
```javascript
typeof obj

a = 42;
typeof a;				// "number"
```
